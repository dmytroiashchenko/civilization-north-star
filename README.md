## Canonical Anchor

### 1) The problem
Companies have strategies. Countries have strategies.  
Humanity has many initiatives, but lacks a widely shared long-term strategy - a guiding direction (“North Star”) at the scale of civilization.

### 2) Two shared constraints (for everyone, without exception)

**Constraint #1: Time (aging).**  
Aging imposes a hard limit and removes unique lives - along with the experience, knowledge, and “memory” carried by each person. This loss is irreversible - every day, as it has been for thousands of years.

**Constraint #2: Space (a single home).**  
Civilization is bound to a single finite “container” - Earth / the Solar System. Resources are limited, risks are non-zero, and long-term habitability is not infinite. One container = a single point of failure.

### 3) The North Star (a simple direction)
1. **Maximize usable time** - reduce biological and cognitive degradation; extend healthy, functional life.  
2. **Expand accessible space** - reduce dependence on a single planet by distributing civilizational risk and expanding access to resources beyond a single “container”.
